# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs - Data Analysis

The project has been made in the scope of my training at Codecademy.com.

## Introduction
In this project, a U.S. medical insurance dataset will be investigated with learnings that has been made through the Python Fundamentals course from Codecademy.

The set of data is a .csv file made of 7 columns. 6 row gives characteristics of patient (age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region) and the seventh row their insurance cost. Informations are a mix of strings, integers or floats and for a total of 1338 patients.

## Projects Goals

There is no specific guidelines given by Codecademy in this exercise.

I propose to analyze the data through the 3 following topics:

1. Know your patient : analyze the characteristics such as average age, region, average bmi etc...
2. Impact of certain characteristics on the Insurance Cost : how much more will pay a smoker, how age impact cost...
3. Estimate the cost for a new patient : from information at disposal, is it possible to estimate our own insurance cost
